# Bird-Plant interactions in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest

In this project, we aim to learn the underlying bird-plant interaction network from a multi-study
data set. Individual studies have inherent taxonomic or geographical biases due to focusing
on a specific set of species or geographical area. We correct for these biases by extending network
modeling to account for truly possible but unrecorded interactions. We also accommodate species
covariates to improve efficiency. Finally, we employ an approach to trait matching which allows us
to identify the traits that are most inflential in forming and detecting species interactions.

## Data set

The data we are using is publicly available in the supporting information of Bello et al (2016).
